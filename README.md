Welcome to my GITHUB! I have two folders, one pertaining to my independent research and class work related to my astrophysics classes, and another to my explorations of data analytics techniques used in sports analysis (and specifically soccer). My work includes homework assisgnments I found particularly interesting in astrophysics, Reports that detail my findings taking observations using the Stone Edge Observatory .5m telescope and analyzing the resulting photos in various ways in python, and finally some personal projects I found fun, inlcuding some basic soccer data analysis and my developing journey learning R and (hopefully soon) SQL for fun. Enjoy!
